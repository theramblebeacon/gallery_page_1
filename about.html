        <h1>Photography is just another artform</h1>
            <p>Even as a small child, all I wanted to do was capture a moment of what I saw in the world around me.  I simply wanted to be able to capture the feeling of a moment, which for me, has always been all tied-up in the light and texture of that world.  
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>After taking pictures for years, seeing how some photos managed to capture some of what I had seen, and how so many fell short, I realized that I could <em>study</em> photography!</p>
            <br>
            <p>In the darkroom I realized that the film wasn't immutable; I could change the exposure and development to change the look and feel of the negative, and then in printing the photo I could change so much more, and even, if I wanted, paint directly with light to change the feel even more</p>
