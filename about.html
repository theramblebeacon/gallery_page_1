        <h1>Photography is just another artform</h1>
            <p>Even as a small child, all I wanted to do was capture a moment of what I saw in the world around me.  I simply wanted to be able to capture the feeling of a moment, which for me, has always been all tied-up in the light and texture of that world.  
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>After taking pictures for years, seeing how some photos managed to capture some of what I had seen, and how so many fell short, I realized that I could <em>study</em> photography!</p>
            <br>
            <p>In the darkroom I realized that the film wasn't immutable; I could change the exposure and development to change the look and feel of the negative, and then in printing the photo I could change so much more, and even, if I wanted, paint directly with light to change the feel even more</p>
            <br>
            <p>With the growth of digital photography, I struggled with what I at first felt was a less-real artform, and couldn't find my place in it.  This led to many years of casual snapshots–a sort of wandering in the desert, looking for visual meaning–but after spending time in that dry place, I <em>did</em> find the way that digital worked for me.  What really did it for me was the realization, simple and obvious as it may seem, that with either form, we're working with light on a sensor.  Period.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Of course then, I had to come to terms with working with the photo using a computer rather than lights and chemicals in a dimly-lit room, but that too, has grown on me, and now I find that the medium is only limited by the limits that I put on it.</p>
